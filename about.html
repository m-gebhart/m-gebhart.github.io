    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
</div>
<div class="content standard">
	<p>I'm a game programmer from Germany, currently enrolled in the <b>Digital Games</b> Bachelor program at <b>Cologne Game Lab</b>, an institute of the University of Applied Sciences Cologne (TH Koeln). For my studies, I focus on the technological aspects of interactive media and the realization of several collaborative projects in each semester.</p>
	<p>I'm convinced that games can reach and embrace audiences in a way that no other medium is able to do so. I would like to break down modern technologies of games to their fundamental elements, to understand them, to research those and to find out how to make games better.</p>
	<p>I want to be one part of a team that <b>makes games that push genres and the medium as a whole forward</b>. A team, that put years and years of hard work and effort into one project, just to release a game one day that impacts people, just like those games all of us grew up with.</p>
	<p>And one day, we can look back at that game and see all the players' experiences they had with it. And now, after many years, these are still the reasons that keep me motivated to be part of this challenging, but great and vast industry.</p>
