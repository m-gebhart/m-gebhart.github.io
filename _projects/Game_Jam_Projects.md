<h2>The Messy Genius</h2>
<img src="/assets/pictures/the-messy-genius_tn.jpg" style="float: left; width: 40%; height: auto; margin: 0.25vw 2vw"><b>The Messy Genius</b> is an action puzzle game for mobile devices where you help Beethoven to finish his masterpieces by dragging various note sheets to the right spots of a stave.

In game, there are various colour-coded note sheets falling down and the player needs to catch and subsequently drag them to the right coloured spot of a stave located in the middle of the screen. The music is adaptive and gets more and more intense with the note sheets being correctly placed.

My responsibilities were implementing the general <b>game logic</b> and control systems.

It was developed with Unity at the <b>Beethoven Game Jam 2019</b>, organized by CGL and WDR3, and won 2nd prize out of eight teams.
