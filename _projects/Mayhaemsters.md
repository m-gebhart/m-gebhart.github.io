previewText: Mayhaemsters is a chaotic multiplayer game where you influence the layout of the map and the way how your friends control the game
---
<b>Mayhaemsters</b> is a last-man-standing competitive multiplayer game for up to four players where your playstyle not only influences the layout of the map, but also the way your friends interact with their own controls.

All in all, Mayhaemsters should surprise its players with breaking conventions and a chaotic yet fun gameplay: <br>Regularly, the map applies significant changes to its layout triggered unconsiously by the players' actions. Furthermore, one of the items that can be activated commonly remaps the key bindings of your enemies' four basic abilities across the same buttons. 

The game is designed to be a thrilling and fun experience that relieves the spirit of ludic couch multiplayer games.
