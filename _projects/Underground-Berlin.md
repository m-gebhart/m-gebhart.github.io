<b>Undergound Berlin</b> is an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) based on a proof a concept for an upcoming web series.
In-game, you investigate mysterious incidents happening in the capitol's underground system. Its puzzles are transmedial, meaning that they are located across various devices such as physical documents and online webpages.

<b>My responsibilities</b> as a <b>programmer</b> were:
<ul>
<li>Web Design</li>
<li>Creating static websites with HTML / CSS</li>
<li>Implementing interactive elements with <b>JavaScript</b></li>
</ul>

The websites are deployed with <b>Jekyll</b> and hosted via Github Pages. In detail, I took care of the full technical implementation of two websites:
<ul>
	<li>The hub, the player can return to after each puzzle: <a href="https://enter-the-sewers.com/" target="_blank">Website</a> | <a href="https://github.com/m-gebhart/enter-the-sewers.github.io" target="_blank">Code</a></li>
	<li>A chat website, putting the player in a linear dialogue: <a href="https://rat-chat.enter-the-sewers.com/" target="_blank">Website</a> | <a href="https://github.com/m-gebhart/the-chat.com" target="_blank">Code</a></li>
</ul>
