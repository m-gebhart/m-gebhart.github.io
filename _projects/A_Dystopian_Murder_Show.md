In <b>A Dystopian Murder Show</b>, a 2D action game, players control two mutants sharing one body. Trapped in deadly arenas, they try to survive against brutal hordes of monsters and get the highest score as possible. It is the very first collaborative project I developed during my studies.

<b>My responsibilities</b> as a <b>game programmer</b> were implementing:
<ul>
	<li><b>General game</b> and player systems</li>
	<li><b>Input Systems</b>, including support for Xbox Game Pad</li>
	<li><b>Combat</b> and enemy behaviour</li>
	<li><b>UI</b>, scene management, camera, menu-, level- and animation systems</li>
	<li><b>Trailer</b> creation with Vegas Movie Studio</li>
</ul>
