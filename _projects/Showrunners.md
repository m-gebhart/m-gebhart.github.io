---

<b>Showrunners</b> was a planned mobile game developed for Android devices and based on <a href="/projects/A_Dystopian_Murder_Show.html">A Dystopian Murder Show</a>.

Besides taking the original concept and adapting its controls and mechanics to touch devices, the project also introduced an in-game currency and shop system with customizable 2D sprites for the character's design, hat and weapon.

It served as an intermediate project during our third study semester where we also explored a lot of aspects on international marketing.

<b>My responsibilities</b> as a <b>producer</b> and <b>second programmer</b> were:
<ul>
	<li><b>Managing</b> development process including overseeing tasks and deadlines and communicating with third parties</li>
	<li>Implementing keyframe character animations for exchangable sprites in the customization system</li>
</ul>
