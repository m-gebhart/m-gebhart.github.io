In my third semester at CGL, I got introduced to C++ and my first solo projects in that language.
My very first project was <b>The Chat Room</b> (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OIWCQ2OCUNr8KwWAZjJ7PB8xbDmNtc4i/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">.exe</a> | <a href="https://github.com/m-gebhart/the-chat-room" target="_blank">Code</a> | <a href="/assets/ChatRoom_Documentation.pdf" target="_blank">Documentation</a>), a narrative dialogue based game that loads the npc's dialogue from external files, presented in the Screenshot above.
<p>The most recent project was a small game engine named <b>PnC Engine</b> (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KkZIryiFGSIHDahtKMBulAFS807SmBsh/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">.exe</a> | <a href="https://github.com/m-gebhart/pncengine" target="_blank">Code</a> | <a href="/assets/PnCEngine_Documentation.pdf" target="_blank">Documentation</a>), that is graphically powered by SFML and focused on creating Point'n'Click adventure game levels that can be simply designed with .xml-files. You can see a small demonstration of it below:</p>
