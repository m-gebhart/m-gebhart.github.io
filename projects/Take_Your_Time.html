    <p><b>Take Your Time</b> is a narrative game, or rather a walking simulator, where you walk down a traffic jam and spot various people's stories in each car, representing different sections of life.

<p><b>My responsibility</b> was:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Visual Scripting</b> / Technical Design in Unreal Engine 4</li>
</ul>
<p>It was developed at the Game Jam 2.0: The Art of Taking a Walk that took place at Cologne Game Lab back in December 2019. It was a 10 to 18 Game Jam, meaning that the hours were fixed and also partly dedicated to academic group reading sessions in regards to the meaning of “walking”.</p>
