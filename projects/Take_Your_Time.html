    <p><b>Take Your Time</b> is a narrative game (rather a walking simulator) where you walk down a traffic jam and spot in each car stories of different people, representing different sections of life. The further you go, the more stories you encounter that you might identify with. The game explores concepts of being free in a world limited my machines and automated structures in modern life.</p>

<p><b>My responsibility</b> was:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Visual Scripting</b> / Technical Design in Unreal Engine 4</li>
</ul>
<p>It was developed at the Game Jam 2.0: The Art of Taking a Walk that took place at Cologne Game Lab back in December 2019. It was a 10 to 18 Game Jam, meaning that the hours were fixed and also partly dedicated to academic group reading sessions in regards to the meaning of “walking”.</p>
