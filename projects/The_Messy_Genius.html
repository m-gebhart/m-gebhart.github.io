    <h2>The Messy Genius</h2>
<h3>2019 - 2D Mobile Puzzle</h3>
<p>  </p>

<p>The Messy Genius is a puzzle game designed for touch devices (e.g. Tablets,
Mobile) and was created at the Beethoven Game Jam 2019.</p>

<p>In game, there are various colour-coded note sheets falling down and the player
needs to catch and subsequently drag them to the right coloured spot of a stave
located in the middle of the screen.</p>
