I am not satisfied with my current skills in C++, but this language is something I want to stick to and keep exploring in my upcoming projects within the next weeks and months. My first bigger project was The Chat Room (Project | Code), presented in the screenshot above. It is a console application that loads the npc&#39;s dialogue from external .xml-files. For February 2020, I will release a small game engine that is based on SFML and focused on creating Point&#39;n&#39;Click adventure games built with .xml-files. For March 2020, I will release a small puzzle game built in Unreal Engine 4, written in C++." />
