    <div class="projectContent">
        <p>During my internship and Jr. programming role at Abstraction Games, I had the opportunity to work on the re-release of Gigantic (original release by Motiga in 2017) where I was part of the core code team from March 2023 until July 2024. Released as <b>Gigantic: Rampage Edition</b> in April 2024, Abstraction provided many improvements and additions such as entire UI overhauls, more guided tutorials, a new game mode called <i>Rush</i>, two new maps, and two new heroes, namely <i>Roland</i> and <i>Kajir</i>.</p>
        <p>My responsibilities mostly consisted of UI programming to increase accessibility and usability despite the technical debt warranted by Unreal Engine 3 and Flash. Later, I also worked on other game programming aspects to fix and create combat and attack behaviour for single heroes.</p>
        <div class="highlights">
            <h2>UI Programming</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Footer Action Bar:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>introducing support for <b>dynamic animations</b>, i.e., a ring-like "filling-up" animation around button images to indicate held buttons of in-progress actions (e.g., purchase actions).</li>
            <li>ensuring consistent spacing and enumerations of elements, including:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>loading in button images either next to or in-between text characters. This is also dependent on the chosen language or input type (gamepad / mouse).</li>
                <li>a priority system that keeps a consistent position index of certain actions (e.g., "ESC" or "Back" always first) independent from data sheets definitions.</li>
                <li>contextual positioning that relatively moves the footer bar horizontally. This is based on distances to other near objects, e.g., to prevent overlaps with party member block in bottom corner.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Character Builds:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>gamepad navigation support.</li>
            <li>custom controls by introducing a <b>drag'n'drop system</b> to better manage order of a hero character's upgrade build:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>detect targeted items of current drag by using a two-pointer system (i.e, find closest item to current mouse coordinates) for placement and hover feedback.</li>
                <li>instant feedback what combinations and modifications are possible while editing:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>indications that some upgrades are dependent on other base upgrades and might require a certain order.</li>
                    <li>index order update when modifying already equipped upgrades, e.g., only swap valid combinations, or "move up" upgrades after deleting upgrades with lower indices to prevent gaps.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Voice Chat UI:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>unified update system to the voice chat UI based on delegates and events:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>custom voice UI for the party block, hero selection screen and scoreboard.</li>
                <li>general UI solutions for gameplay, transition screens and other.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>support for mute and block actions as well as joining or leaving players to refresh session states.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Shield and Health UI:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>complete rework of shield and health UI to now share the total bar instead of one bar overlapping the other:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>smoothened shield bar's refill animation when recharging.</li>
                <li>improved shield bar's damage loss "burn" animation.</li>
                <li>extra health buff (prior display as separate bar) now part as usual health.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>generalized shield bar implementation to improve display for any heroes, no matter whether shield is permanent or temporary only:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>e.g., whilst <i>Rutger</i> has a permament shield that auto-heals, the shield could also only be temporary with <i>HK's</i> or <i>Zandora's</i> skill.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>End of Match:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Rush</i> mode: with the option to change heroes mid-match, I added an internal counting system to be able display the most played hero by each player.</li>
            <li>Finalized MPR system:</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And many other UI implementions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>skill interval counter to the HUD, showing when a certain skill can execute a timed effect, e.g., <i>Wu</i> can do a Cyclone Kick every 3s on its primary attack.</li>
            <li>rework and visual overhaul of the hero selection screen</li>
            <li>general HUD change to a more blue-green and gradient-based palette for contrast.</li>
            <li>rework of AoE outlines with contrast colors and limiting visibility to only affected players to better perceive heal and damage outlines of hero skills.</li>
            <li>fixes to tutorial hint displays, gamepad navigations, and many other UI bugfixes!</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="highlights">
            <h2>Gameplay Programming:</h2>
        </div>
        <p>AI Programming and Character Skills / Upgrades:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Roland</i> drone and AoE debuff fixes.</li>
            <li><i>Kajir</i> smoke skill and AI fixes.</li>
        </ul>
