        <p>During my internship and then my Jr. programming role at Abstraction Games, I had the opportunity to work on the re-release of Gigantic (original release by Motiga in 2017) where I was part of the core code team from March 2023 until July 2024. Released as Gigantic: Rampage Edition in April 2024, Abstraction provided many improvements and additions such as entire UI overhauls, more guided tutorials, a new game mode called <i>Rush</i>, two new maps, and two new heroes, namely <i>Roland</i> and <i>Kajir</i>.</p>
        <p>My responsibilities mostly consisted of UI programming to increase accessibility and usability despite the technical debt warranted by Unreal Engine 3 and Flash. Later, I also moved to other game programming aspects to fix and create combat and attack behaviour for single heroes.</p>
