        <p>During my internship and Jr. programming role at Abstraction Games, I had the opportunity to work on the re-release of Gigantic (original release by Motiga in 2017) where I was part of the core code team from March 2023 until July 2024. Released as Gigantic: Rampage Edition in April 2024, Abstraction provided many improvements and additions such as entire UI overhauls, more guided tutorials, a new game mode called <i>Rush</i>, two new maps, and two new heroes, namely <i>Roland</i> and <i>Kajir</i>.</p>
        <p>My responsibilities mostly consisted of UI programming to increase accessibility and usability despite the technical debt warranted by Unreal Engine 3 and Flash. Later, I also worked on other game programming aspects to fix and create combat and attack behaviour for single heroes.</p>
        <p>Menu systems and front end screens: I worked on the general footer action bar that dynamically loads in button prompt elements dependent on the currently selected item. My responsibilities were:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>introducing support for dynamic animations, i.e., a ring-like "filling-up" animation around button images to indicate held buttons of in-progress actions.</li>
            <li>ensuring consistent spacing and numerations of elements, including:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>loading in button images either next to or in-between text characters. This is also dependent on the chosen language or input type (gamepad / mouse).</li>
                <li>pushing the footer bar horizontally if other objects are close and should not overlap, e.g., party member block in bottom corner.</li>
                <li>a priority system that keeps consistent positions of certain actions (e.g., "ESC" or "Back" on the left), independent from data sheets definitions.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Builds and Upgrades: I introduced custom controls, i.e., drag'n'drop, to better manage customized builds of hero characters.</p>
