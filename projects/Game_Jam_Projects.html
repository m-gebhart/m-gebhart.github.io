<h2>The Messy Genius</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/pictures/the-messy-genius_tn.jpg" style="float: left; width: 40%; height: auto; margin: 0.25vw 2vw" /><b>The Messy Genius</b> is an action puzzle game for mobile devices where you help Beethoven to finish his masterpieces by dragging various note sheets to the right spots of a stave.</p>

<p>In game, there are various colour-coded note sheets falling down and the player needs to catch and subsequently drag them to the right coloured spot of a stave located in the middle of the screen. The music is adaptive and gets more and more intense with the note sheets being correctly placed.</p>

<p>My responsibilities were implementing the general <b>game logic</b> and control systems.</p>

<p>It was developed with Unity at the <b>Beethoven Game Jam 2019</b>, organized by CGL and WDR3, and won 2nd prize out of eight teams.</p>
