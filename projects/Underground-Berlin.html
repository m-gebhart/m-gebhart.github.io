    <p><b>Undergound Berlin</b> is an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) based on a proof a concept for a web series called <a href="https://www.prettygoodideas.studio/pretty-interactive.html"><i>Der Grund Unter Berlin</i>.</a></p>
<p>In-game, you investigate mysterious incidents happening in the capitol's underground system. Its puzzles are transmedial, meaning that they are located across various devices such as physical documents and online webpages.</p>
<p><b>My responsibilities</b> were:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Pitching</b> initial design concept</li>
	<li>Creating static websites with <b>JavaScript</b>, HTML and CSS</li>
</ul>

<p>The websites are deployed with <b>Jekyll</b> and hosted via Github Pages. In detail, I took care of the full technical implementation of two websites:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The hub, the player can return to after each puzzle: <a href="https://enter-the-sewers.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://github.com/m-gebhart/enter-the-sewers.github.io">Code</a></li>
	<li>A chat website, putting the player in a linear dialogue: <a href="https://rat-chat.enter-the-sewers.com/">Website</a> | <a href="https://github.com/m-gebhart/the-chat.com">Code</a></li>
</ul>
